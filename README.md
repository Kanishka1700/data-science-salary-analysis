# 💼 Data Science Job Salaries: Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes a real-world dataset of data science job salaries.  
We explore salary patterns across countries, job titles, experience levels, and remote ratios, and build predictive models using machine learning.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle – Data Science Job Salaries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries)
- The dataset includes salary information for data science roles globally, including job title, location, experience level, and salary in USD.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

We perform:
- Descriptive statistics
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations such as bar plots, box plots, heatmaps, and PCA for cluster visualization
- Feature importance exploration

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Classification Models** for salary brackets
- **K-Means Clustering** to group job profiles by features

## 🔧 Techniques Applied

- Label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Feature importance analysis
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Elbow method for choosing k in clustering

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Job title**, **experience level**, and **remote work ratio** significantly influence salary.
- **Random Forest** provides better prediction accuracy compared to linear models.
- K-Means reveals distinct job profile clusters with similar salary characteristics.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
